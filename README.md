## A CSS grid

A grid that doesn't fill up your CSS with glossy buttons, overworked typography base or styles that you'll never use. I've used this on a number of projects and I think it gets the job done. Feel free to use it if you like.

Its just a grid.

### Usage

Manual:

1. Download repo
2. Copy [```grid.css```](https://github.com/daviddarnes/flynn/blob/master/grid/grid.css) into your project

Bower:

1. ```bower install --save https://github.com/daviddarnes/flynn.git```
2. Import the file with your normal project process

### Preprocessors

The ```.css``` file is used by default in bower, however you can redefine it to either [```.less```](https://github.com/daviddarnes/flynn/blob/master/grid/grid.less) or [```.scss```](https://github.com/daviddarnes/flynn/blob/master/grid/grid.scss) for less or sass preprocessing.
